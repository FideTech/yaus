# YAUS (yet another url shortener)

## Why YAUS?
Because the other url shortener services seemed over complicated.

## Concept
The concept of YAUS is simple. The `config.yaml` drives how the serivce works.
In the config file there will be port configuration, storage, and all of that.
Then another section with hardcoded redirection values.
